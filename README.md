# Qmanage - Mobile App for QR based Event Management
 		
Unique python generated QR codes are generated for and shared to every person. The backend is a FireBase database that stores the details of every participant.
The organiser can use the app to scan the QR code of a participant and update their relevant categories (checked in, round 1 done etc.) 
SuperUser/Admin access is provided through appScripts on Google sheets.
